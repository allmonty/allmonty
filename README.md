### About Me

Hey there! I'm a full-stack software engineer who's passionate about building things that make a real difference. I'm all about functional programming and get a kick out of crafting high-performance systems. I've spent time at some of Latin America's big banks, where I helped build platforms that could handle millions of requests every day, ensuring they were rock-solid and reliable. I love working with other people, sharing ideas, and innovating together.

On the academic side, I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a postgraduate degree in AI and Machine Learning, a field I'm incredibly interested in and always looking to explore more.

When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying my other passions: photography üì∑, playing the trumpet üé∫, trying new drinks üçª, brewing a good coffee ‚òï, or getting into some games üéÆ.
